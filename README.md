# ArchFlow - The Intelligent IT Architecture Hub

**Streamline, Visualize, Decide. Your Agile IT Architecture, Accelerated by AI.**

---

## üöÄ Overview

ArchFlow is a revolutionary web-based platform designed to empower IT architects, technical leads, and development teams to collaboratively document, visualize, and evolve their software and enterprise architectures with unparalleled efficiency. By intelligently combining leading architectural standards, modern diagramming capabilities, and cutting-edge generative AI, ArchFlow transforms chaotic documentation into a living, interconnected knowledge base.

---

## üéØ The Problem ArchFlow Solves

* **Fragmented Documentation:** Architectural knowledge is scattered across wikis, documents, and diagramming tools, making it hard to find, maintain, and ensure consistency.
* **Stale Information:** Manual updates and tedious diagramming lead to outdated architectural views that no longer reflect reality.
* **Slow Decision-Making:** Lack of clarity on past decisions and their context hinders new architectural choices and introduces technical debt.
* **Communication Gaps:** Difficulty effectively communicating complex architectural concepts to diverse stakeholders.
* **High Effort in Content Creation:** Writing comprehensive documentation and drawing detailed diagrams is time-consuming.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Value Proposition

1.  **Structured Architectural Documentation (Arc42 Powered):**
    * Organize your architecture logically using the proven Arc42 standard, ensuring completeness and consistency.
    * Dedicated sections for Context, Building Blocks, Runtime, Deployment, Quality Goals, and more.
    * *Value:* Provides a single source of truth, making it easy for anyone to understand your architecture.

2.  **Interactive C4 Model Visualizations (Structurizr DSL & Kroki):**
    * Define your C4 Model diagrams (Context, Container, Component, Code) using intuitive Structurizr DSL.
    * See live previews of your diagrams rendered seamlessly by Kroki, directly within the platform.
    * *Value:* Breaks down complex systems into digestible visual layers, fostering shared understanding and reducing ambiguity.

3.  **AI-Powered Content Generation (Gemini API Integration):**
    * Leverage generative AI to instantly draft content for Arc42 sections, Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), or even generate initial Structurizr DSL.
    * Simply provide a prompt, and let AI kickstart your documentation efforts.
    * *Value:* Significantly reduces manual writing effort, accelerates documentation, and helps overcome writer's block.

4.  **Architectural Decision Records (ADR) Management:**
    * Systematically capture the "why" behind key architectural decisions using structured ADRs.
    * Link ADRs directly to relevant architectural components or documentation sections.
    * *Value:* Preserves critical context, prevents revisiting old decisions, and simplifies onboarding for new team members.

5.  **Interconnected Architectural Knowledge Base:**
    * Establish explicit relationships between any architectural artifact: link an ADR to a C4 component, a requirement to an Arc42 section, or a canvas to a system.
    * Navigate seamlessly between related documentation, diagrams, and decisions.
    * *Value:* Builds a rich, navigable web of architectural knowledge, enhancing understanding and traceability.

6.  **Agile Architecture Principles Embraced:**
    * Designed to support iterative documentation and continuous evolution, aligning with Open Agile Architecture principles.
    * *Value:* Keeps your architecture documentation lightweight, up-to-date, and adaptable to change.

7.  **Foundational Canvas Support (Arc42 Inception & Communication):**
    * Store and link data derived from the Arc42 Inception and Communication Canvases, ensuring early architectural alignment.
    * *Value:* Facilitates structured architectural workshops and effective communication planning from the outset.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Runway

ArchFlow is built on a robust foundation designed for scalability and extensibility:

* **Backend & Database:** Google Firebase (Firestore for NoSQL data storage with real-time sync, and Authentication for user management).
* **Deployment:** Static site hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages).
* **Frontend Framework:** React.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent UI development.
* **Generative AI:** Integrated with the Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash` model) for AI-powered content generation.
* **Diagram Rendering:** Utilizes Kroki.io for on-the-fly rendering of Structurizr DSL into SVG diagrams.
* **Data Model:** A flexible Firestore schema for `systems` and `architectural_artifacts`, supporting relationships between different artifact types.

## üìà Work Breakdown (Epics)

The development of ArchFlow is structured into the following Epics, providing a clear roadmap for implementation:

* **Epic 1: Core Platform Setup & User Management (Foundation):** Establishing Firebase integration, basic UI, and anonymous user authentication.
* **Epic 2: System & Arc42 Documentation Management (Core ArchFlow):** Enabling the creation, viewing, and management of IT systems and their Arc42-structured documentation.
* **Epic 3: C4 Model & Diagramming (Visualization):** Integrating Structurizr DSL and Kroki for interactive C4 Model diagramming and preview.
* **Epic 4: Architectural Decision Records (ADR):** Implementing functionality to capture, manage, and browse Architectural Decision Records.
* **Epic 5: Generative AI Assistant Integration (Intelligence Layer):** Integrating the Gemini API to provide AI assistance for content generation.
* **Epic 6: Artifact Relationships & Linking (Interconnectivity):** Enabling users to define and visualize relationships between different architectural artifacts.
* **Epic 7: Refinement & UX Enhancements (Polish & Usability):** Improving the overall user experience, including enhanced layouts, basic Markdown rendering, and better error handling.
* **Epic (Future): Advanced Features:** Placeholder for future functionalities like a dedicated artifact viewer, advanced search, and collaborative editing.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers)

To get ArchFlow up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/archflow-it-architecture-hub.git](https://github.com/your-username/archflow-it-architecture-hub.git)
    cd archflow-it-architecture-hub
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Firebase Configuration:** Ensure your Firebase project is set up and its configuration is correctly provided to the application (e.g., via environment variables or a build process that injects `__firebase_config` and `__app_id`).
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
